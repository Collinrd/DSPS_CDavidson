Homework 3:   
Background Questions: Dakota Neumann  
Data Ingestion: Siddharth Patel  
Data Exploration: Siddharth Patel and Dakota  
Data Analysis: Collin Davidson and Siddharth Patel  
Final conclusions: Collin Davidson  

Partners were Siddharth Patel and Dakota Neumann. We met on Zoom on Saturday to plan and review the beginning code that Sid worked out. Then separately we checked the code for the data ingestion and data exploration. We met in person on Sunday. I had spent the earlier portion of the day working out what we had to do to analyze the data. We discussed and worked through confusion together. Sid helped a great deal with writing the code, Dakota with writing out the captions. 

  

The homework was about the reproducabliity of the study of "Statistical Tests for Scaling in the Inter-Event Times of Earthquakes in California" (Correll's 2018) and the K-S test involved within.  
The hardest part for me was with some of the code involved especially in regard to the data anaylsis where I understood what needed to be done, but struggled in the execution.  
The easiest part for me was figuring out the K-S tests. Those made sense with relative ease.
