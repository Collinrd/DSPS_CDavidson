Homework 3:   
Background Questions: Dakota Neumann  
Data Ingestion: Siddharth Patel  
Data Exploration: Siddharth Patel and Dakota  
Data Analysis: Collin Davidson and Siddharth Patel  
Final conclusions: Collin Davidson  

Partners were Siddharth Patel and Dakota Neumann. We met on Zoom on Saturday to plan and review the beginning code that Sid worked out. Then separately we checked the code for the data ingestion and data exploration. We met in person on Sunday. I had spent the earlier portion of the day working out what we had to do to analyze the data. We discussed and worked through confusion together. Sid helped a great deal with writing the code, Dakota with writing out the captions. 

  

The homework was about the reproducabliity of the study of "Statistical Tests for Scaling in the Inter-Event Times of Earthquakes in California" (Correll's 2018) and the K-S test involved within.  
The hardest part for me was with some of the code involved especially in regard to the data anaylsis where I understood what needed to be done, but struggled in the execution.  
The easiest part for me was figuring out the K-S tests. Those made sense with relative ease.

Homework 5:  

Partner was Dakota Neumann. We got started on Saturday, discussing what the exercises were asking and figuring out how to go about doing them. We did a bit of work separately afterwards. Dakota figured out how to do the matrix operations in python. I wrote the code for the plots and for exercise 3 (which was mostly an extension of what Dakota had written the day before.) I then wrote the captions for the graphs, including answering some of the posed questions. We met back together in person on Sunday and spend most of the time in discussion together trying to understand exercise 4. We formulated the expression together and Dakota wrote it out nicely in colab.   
  
The homework was about fitting models to data. More specifically in regard to linear and quadratic fits, and constructing an objective function that represents the quality of the fit.  
The hardest part for me was translating my understanding of matricies to my understanding of python. (Also, trying to get the graph of the quadratic fit to be smooth was a bit of a nuisance.)   
The easiest part was plotting and commenting on the fitted models placed upon the data.
