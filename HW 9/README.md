Homework 9   
This assignment involved using a pretrained neural network to produce DeepDream images. It started with putting an image of "noise" through the process to see what it produces. Then by putting any given image through the network to see how it brings out "animal" shapes from within the image.  
The most difficult part of this homework was just trying to wrap my head around what was happening, but going through the code and understanding the layers of the network's process helped me see somewhat better how neural nets may work.  
The easiest aspect was inputting the code because there wasn't a ton to figure out on my own.
