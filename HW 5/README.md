Homework 5:  

Partner was Dakota Neumann. We got started on Saturday, discussing what the exercises were asking and figuring out how to go about doing them. We did a bit of work separately afterwards. Dakota figured out how to do the matrix operations in python. I wrote the code for the plots and for exercise 3 (which was mostly an extension of what Dakota had written the day before.) I then wrote the captions for the graphs, including answering some of the posed questions. We met back together in person on Sunday and spend most of the time in discussion together trying to understand exercise 4. We formulated the expression together and Dakota wrote it out nicely in colab.   
  
The homework was about fitting models to data. More specifically in regard to linear and quadratic fits, and constructing an objective function that represents the quality of the fit.  
The hardest part for me was translating my understanding of matricies to my understanding of python. (Also, trying to get the graph of the quadratic fit to be smooth was a bit of a nuisance.)   
The easiest part was plotting and commenting on the fitted models placed upon the data.
